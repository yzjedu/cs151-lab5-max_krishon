In this lab, we were supposed to learn how to design a program that asks users for inputs, checking the inputs,\
making decisions based on these inputs, and looping the code to continue until a SENTINEL is entered.

The steps that were followed were to first establish the variables needed in the program. Next, we generated a while loop
to run code as long as SENTINEL wasn't inputted. Next, we created ifs to run calculations for the corresponding values and outputting balance values. Lastly, we ensured the code recognized the total balance being below zero and outputted the string.

Some challenges we came across was understanding how to error check user values and how to continue running value until SENTINEL was input.
We were able to solve these issues with assistance from the professor and thinking about the program process in detail.

I enjoyed being a partner with Max, since it was easy to brainstorm these processes with him. Additionally, Max understands topics very quickly which made implementing them easier.
