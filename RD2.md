What I learned from this lab was how to impliment while loops in my code and how to create and ATM interface. 
- Steps I followed was first discuss with my partner how we think the program should look like then write it out as an algortihm
- we then typed up test cases of what the outputs would be based on the inputs.
- Key concepts we explored were while loops and error checking.
- A challenged we encountered is how to loop the program back to the beggining after the user runs through the program.
- We overcame them by asking peers for help and the teacher for guidance.
- We learned how to use while loops and how to better collaborate.
- Working with Krishon went well and he helped explain many concepts to me. He was very knowledgable and very good at explaining and talking through concepts
